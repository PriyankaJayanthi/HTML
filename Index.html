    <h1> What is a healthy diet?</h1>
    <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love.
         Rather, its about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood. </p>
    <p>By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty, 
        varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.</p>

        <h1>The fundamentals of healthy eating</h1>
        <p> Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive function. 
            Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein,
             especially as we age.</p>
        <p>Fat. Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. 
                 In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and emotional health</p>
        <p>Fiber. Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can help you stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease,
             stroke, and diabetes. It can also improve your skin and even help you to lose weight.</p>

        <p>Healthy eating is the basis for a healthy life. It improves your performance and your well-being 
            and gives your body what it needs. Moreover, many diseases can be prevented with the right nutrition. 
            Since every person is different and every body has different needs, there is no general recommendation for a healthy diet </p>
